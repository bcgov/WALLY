    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>There are two options currently available to further refine the EFN results for your selected watershed.
      These toggles are available under the Species Sensitivity header below.</p>
    <p>1. "Highly sensitive species in the area" will disable the risk calculations and display because special consideration should be taken in this scenario.</p>
    <p>2. "Fish bearing watershed" will update the risk calculations to use the more sensitive risk thresholds when calculating the monthly risk levels.</p>

      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        The EFN risk values presented here by WALLY are based upon the 2016 Evironmental Risk Management Framework.
        The following graphic shows a chart that outlines the flow sensitivity logic used to determine monthly risk levels.
